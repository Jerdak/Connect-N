This is a simple implementation of a Connect-N AI using
MiniMax and AlphaBeta pruning.

The code was written to support a class project so the
GitHub port is likely to have comments I made to the
professor.

If you run the code as-is you'll see the AI post the name
'Joshua' to the command line. This was our "referees" cue
to input the board configuration.  To manually play the game,
enter the following:

8 8 4 0 10

This sets up an 8x8 board where the player needs 4 in a row
to win.  The fourth value is who starts, 0 = AI.  The last
value 10 is the amount of time the AI has to "think".

There isn't a prompt for your input but since the AI goes first,
as soon as you see the game board enter a numeric value from 0-7
where the value represents the column to drop in a token.  The AI
will then take 10 seconds to come up with a counter.
